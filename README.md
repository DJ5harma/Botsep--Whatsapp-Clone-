# Yea, a whatsapp clone in progress which will help gain experience and skills along the way...

JS Tech stack and work done so far:

Using mongoose: 
  User, Message and Chat models.
  
Using express, node: 
  Routes, Controllers and middleware for Account creation, logging, getting all the users, chat and messages.
  
Using React, router-dom: 
  signup, login and home page static layouts with initial basic design.


### Upcoming plans: 

To practice a lil and use Redux Toolkit if state management gets out of practical control (don't think so it'll happen),
Use tailwind if feels like it,
Use Multer and Cloudinary for file uploads,
and.... Will update.

# BE and FE not connected yet.
